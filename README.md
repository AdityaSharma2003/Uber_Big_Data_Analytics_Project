# Uber (Big Data Project)

This project is a Big Data Modelling project in order to bring out the real time analysis of the Uber data such as :-
1. The regions where the taxi services are used frequently
2. The locations where the maximum pickups and drops have been encountered
3. The details about the passenger counts per ride
4. The fare amounts of different trips, their distances and also payment type chosen often by the customers
5. The total amount generated from a trip including fare_amount, extra, mta_tax, tip_amount, tolls_amount and improvement surcharge.

## Project Description
1. Visualised the raw data into Fact and Dimension tables using Lucidcharts.com
2. Wrote the transformation logic using Pandas in Python to model the Big Data as per the planned format on Jupyter notebooks
3. Extracted the the Dimension tables from the Big Data using Python and connected them with the Fact table using Primary and Foreign keys
4. Implemented the Data Loader, Transformer and Data Exporter, ETL Pipeline using Mage.Ai, to finally convert the 100k column Raw data into the said Structure.
5. Migrated the transformed Data to Google Cloud Platform.
6. Loaded the transformed data into bigQuery on Google Cloud Platform
7. Analysed and ran queries on 15000KB+ data using MySQL on bigQuery
8. Grouped and Joined the Dimension tables with the Fact table
9. Presented the final data on the dashboard, created using Googleâ€™s Looker Studio for analysing the refined data.
